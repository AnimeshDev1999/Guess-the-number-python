## How to play ?

- The game will first ask you to choose a custom range or play on default range (i.e. 0 to 10).
- After you select the range, the game will pick a random number within the range.
- The guess chances will be based on the following table:

| Range      | Chances |
| ---------- | ------- |
| 0 to 15    | 5       |
| 15 or more | 10      |

- The game will then let you guess the number till you have chances left.

## Cheats

As of now the game only has one cheat code i.e. **show** to use this cheat, input **show** instead of (y/n) when game asks wheather you want to input custom range.

After applying cheat, input custom range and the secret number will be displayed right in the start of game.
